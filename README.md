This is my solution for the Tic-Tac-Toe project as part of "The Odin Project" course.

I built it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. On the JavaScript side, I tried to limit my use of global variables.

Things to possibly improve/add in the future:
- a way to edit the players' names without needing to reload the page
- a way to highlight the winning combo, maybe striking a line through it
- a way to play against the machine
